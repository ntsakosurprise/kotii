# Introduction

## Welcome

Kotii is a meta framework that has been made to be simple and intuitive. It is currently designed to work with React. There are also considerations to integrate it with other mainstream JavaScript frameworks.

Kotii is actually from one of the languages in South Africa known as XiTsonga or simply Tsonga. The name Kotii itself is derived from the word “kotani”, which in English is translated to mean “be able (to build with)”

It was initially intended to be a boilerplate under the react framework paradigm, but evolved overtime into a framework instead, as a result of a strong desire that the initial author had of creating something meaningful.

### Code Snippets

As an added convenience, some pages might have code snippets that you can quickly copy and integrate into your work in progress. This may not be as needed, but it can be imagined that there may be a case of usage for it.

As an example, you may be reading about how a given component works and wish to quickly test that part of the component before you fully utilise it, and in that case, it would be convenient for you to just quickly copy, paste, and test.

Please refer to the code below for an example of a snippet:

```jsx
import * as React from React
import Card from "./project/cardpath/card"

const CardDisplayer = ()=>{
    return(
            <Card bgColor="red" size={20}>
                <span>This is a test card</span>
            </Card>
        )

}

export default CardDisplayer;

```

### Interactive Editor

In some cases, this documentation provides an interactive editor where you can type and edit code with live results. This has an added benefit that further immense you into the project as gives you instant results that can visually aid you and give you an idea of how a given feature is implemented.

A picture is worth a glancing, please refer to the interactive editor below:
