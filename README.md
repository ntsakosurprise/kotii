# Project Building Instructions

iOCO carousel a simple and lightweight carousel that utilizes the react framework. 



 When I first started work on this project, I wanted to achieve two things: 

1. Build a custom carousel component that was entirely based on my own algorithms and taste of design

2. Build a second reusable carousel that was entirely based on others' approaches, and thereby utilising the react framework libraries


As I started out the project, I set out to follow the intended approach, but after some time in the process, I encountered some minor issue with the time and some other project I was part of. 

By the time I got off the other project that had taken my needed time, I realised that I had less time to work on my initial approach, so I went to skip the custom approach and just went with the project really required me to do, which is going the second option route.

Following that second option in building the project, I took the following approach: 

1. I installed a popular react library known as react-slick to kick-start the project. I have used this library in the past with the jQuery library, so it became easier for me to quickly the project going. 

2. I set up my carousel component with a state made up of items that I needed displayed on the carousel. 

3. I've made some configurations to get the carousel to where I wanted it. 

4. I did an override of some of the react-slick styles to get the exact design design and outcome that I needed 

5. Because I had already styled the content, getting the component to work was quick. 

6. I have used the external CSS approach for all my CSS. 

7. The code uses the latest React framework (as of this publish) for the project, albeit with a slight old approach (I could have used the latest approach, but I decided otherwise just to quickly save time) 


8. The project uses sass for creating the styling information. 

9. The project is catered for three popular devices using responsive design.
