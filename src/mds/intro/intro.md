# Introduction

## Welcome

This is a documentaion website for MyMtnNextgen app and its related resources. The site has been made with the purpose of helping anyone understand the project and its implementation better and in detail.

It has been made to be very simple and intuitive, following a chronological order presentation style. In preparing the documentation, the team has placed a greater emphasis on new developers who have a little to no insight into the ins and outs of the project.

Nonetheless, this documentation has also been made effective enough to cater for seasoned developers to aid them in their daily work operations in the context of <blockquote>myMTN </blockquote>.

In the context of _MyMtnNextgen_, this documentation site presents information about things such as the _project set up_, _framework_, _conventions_ used and followed, _best practices_, _components_ usage, and many other features.

### Code Snippets

As an added convenience, some pages might have code snippets that you can quickly copy and integrate into your work in progress. This may not be as needed, but it can be imagined that there may be a case of usage for it.

As an example, you may be reading about how a given component works and wish to quickly test that part of the component before you fully utilise it, and in that case, it would be convenient for you to just quickly copy, paste, and test.

Please refer to the code below for an example of a snippet:

```jsx
import * as React from React
import Card from "./project/cardpath/card"

const CardDisplayer = ()=>{
    return(
            <Card bgColor="red" size={20}>
                <span>This is a test card</span>
            </Card>
        )

}

export default CardDisplayer;

```
